---Upwork is a freelancing site in USA and my team is working on it to catch jobs and making money.

I know the way to get cool IT jobs and get projects in Upwork with many years of experience.

---The only thing I want from you is to create and share your Upwork account to me.

Here I can make over $3000~$10000 every month and I am going to share 15%~20% to you. This means that you can get $450~$2000 in revenue every month.

What I will do?
- My team will use your Upwork account on your  laptop by using Anydesk or Teamviewer. (This is needed because Upwork has location detection bot)
-Create/Update profile and send proposals to customers.
-I will handle text chats and work on projects from Upwork to make money.

What do I need from you for the account?
-Prepare and turn on a spare laptop that has Anydesk/Teamviewer set up.
-Handle interview calls if it is needed.

How we share money from Upwork?
-I will withdraw money from Upwork to you (Paypal or Card)
-Then we can split it, you should send 80%~85% of income to my Paypal from your Paypal or Card.

To get more jobs and projects in Upwork, we need more accounts than we have.
Let us help each other.
